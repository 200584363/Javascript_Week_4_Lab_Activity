# Javascript-Week-4-Lab-Activity

This repository contains solutions to four JavaScript challenges. Each challenge covers a different concept, from basic number manipulation to conditional logic, function creation, and loops.

## Question 1: Checking for a Multiple of 5

The task is to get a user to input a number using `prompt("Enter a number")`. After receiving the input, the code checks if the entered number is a multiple of 5 or not.

- **Input**: Number entered by the user.
- **Logic**: If the number is divisible by 5, it prints a message saying it's a multiple of 5. Otherwise, it says it's not a multiple.

## Question 2: Grade Assignment Based on Scores

The program assigns grades to students based on their scores. It prompts the user to enter their score and gives them a grade according to the following scale:

- **80 - 100**: Grade A
- **70 - 79**: Grade B
- **60 - 69**: Grade C
- **50 - 59**: Grade D
- **0 - 49**: Grade F

The user is prompted to `("Enter your score")`, and based on the entered score, the appropriate grade is assigned and displayed.

## Question 3: Calculator Challenge

A function called `calculator` is created, which takes three parameters:

1. **num1**: The first number.
2. **num2**: The second number.
3. **operator**: The operator can be `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`.

The function returns the result of the calculation based on the operator. If any other operator is passed, the function returns an error message.

## Question 4: FizzBuzz Challenge

This challenge logs numbers from `startNumber` to `endNumber`, both of which are entered by the user. For each number, the program follows these rules:

- **Multiples of 3**: Print "Fizz" instead of the number.
- **Multiples of 5**: Print "Buzz" instead of the number.
- **Multiples of both 3 and 5**: Print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
